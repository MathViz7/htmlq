### Additional settings (vs. FlashQ)

HtmlQ introduces a few new settings that were not available in FlashQ:

`settings/config.xml`:

```xml
    <!-- Disable the back button within the page. Users can always use the browser back button to navigate the survey anyway. -->
    <item id="disableBackButton">true</item>
```


`settings/language.xml`:

```xml
    <!-- Label of the back button -->
    <item id="backButton">Back</item>

    <!-- Message that is shown to the user when not all required fields in step 5 were filled in -->
    <item id="fillInRequiredFields">Please fill in all required fields.</item>

    <!-- Warning that will be displayed to the user if they try to navigate away from the questionnaire and could lose their data -->
    <item id="leaveSiteWarning">Your answers will be lost.</item>
```

## Custom Logos

You can add up to three images (e.g. company logos) to the header by replacing the respective `logo.jpg`, `logo_center.jpg` and `logo_right.jpg` files.
